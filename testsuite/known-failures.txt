GCC torture test known failures for m68k-human68k
==================================================

Results: 14832 pass / 22 fail (1 unresolved)
Tested at 6 optimization levels: -O0, -O1, -O2, -O3, -O3 -g, -Os

None of the failures are codegen bugs. All fall into these categories:


No PIC/GOT support (15 failures)
---------------------------------
  pr71626-2.c   all levels (3 results per level: blank lines, excess errors, execution)

This test requires -fpic (position-independent code), which needs a Global
Offset Table (GOT). Human68k is a bare-metal target with no dynamic linker
or shared library support, so -fpic is not implemented. The X68000 loads
executables at fixed addresses assigned by the OS and uses a relocation
table in the X-file header instead.


No Inf/NaN in soft-float (6 failures)
--------------------------------------
  conversion.c  -O0 only
  pr39228.c     -O0, -O1, -O2, -O3 -g, -Os

The 68000 has no FPU, so all floating-point is done in software via
libgcc's soft-float routines (lb1sf68.S). These routines do not generate
or propagate IEEE 754 special values (infinity, NaN, denormals). The tests
rely on detecting Inf from overflow or NaN from 0.0/0.0 and fail because
soft-float returns ordinary (wrong) numeric results instead.


ELF label-difference (1 failure + 1 unresolved)
------------------------------------------------
  pr41239.c     -O3 -g only (compile error, not execution)

At -O3 -g, GCC emits DWARF debug info containing a .word directive with
a difference of two labels in different subsections (e.g. .word .Lfoo-.Lbar).
The m68k ELF assembler (gas) cannot resolve label differences that cross
subsection boundaries and rejects it with "unsupported relocation". This
only manifests at -O3 -g because other optimization levels don't produce
the specific code pattern that triggers the cross-subsection reference in
debug info.
